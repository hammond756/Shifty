# Shifty
My submission for the course Programming Project 2015.

## The idea ##
Shifty is a marketplace for shifts whithin small businesses. The app alows employees to view each others scheduele and post request for shifts that they want to be filled in by others or volunteer to work a certain shift. All this information will be available to all relevant employees at the company. This idea came to mind because I work at a restaurant where all servers are part-timers that study/have a life on the side. All this (trading shifts) is currently done via What's-app and there is no overview of all the activity, which is cause for disputes from time to time.

##### Funcionality:
- Request
- Volunteer
- Overview of weekly scheduele
- Overview of all requests per date

## Possible complications ##
For this App to be usefull, it must have networking functionality. This is something that is new to me, but very willing to figure out. However, this may proof itself to be more complicated than expected.  
A real world issue is that the app will only be available on iOS devices and it won't reach it's full potential until the data can be shared between all (or the most common) platforms.

## Planning ##

| Week | Goal | Description |
|:------:|:------:|---------|
|1     | Interface | Implement a working interface in the Xcode storyboard. Working segues (with hard-coded content) |
|2     | User profiles | Let new users create a profile and fill in their weekly schedule |
|3     | Interaction | User can engage with the weekly schedule and reply to requests |
